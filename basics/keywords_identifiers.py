Python Identifiers
    * An identifier is a name given to entities like class, functions, variables, etc. It helps to differentiate one entity from another.
    * rules - Identifiers can be a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore _ .
    * An identifier cannot start with a digit. 1variable is invalid, but variable1 is a valid name.
    * Keywords cannot be used as identifiers.
    * We cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, $, % etc. in our identifier
